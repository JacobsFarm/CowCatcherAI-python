# 🐄 CowCatcher AI

### This is a fork of the official CowcatcherAI repository

This fork is based on the very first version of the CowcatcherAI code, originally developed by Jacob's Farm. The code is written entirely in Python and serves as a solid foundation for a variety of AI projects.
This project is easier to modify due to its Python-based structure and its standalone interface. It is ideal for developers who prefer a flexible and easily editable version — or for pioneers who appreciate the original CowcatcherAI code over the modern implementations.

**CowCatcher AI** is an open-source computer vision system designed to monitor your herd 24/7. By analyzing live footage from your barn cameras, it automatically detects "mounting" behavior—the primary sign of estrus (heat)—and instantly sends a photo notification to your smartphone via Telegram or combine it with your Home assistant setup.

> **Powered by** [**eschouten/ai-detector**](https://github.com/eschouten/ai-detector)
> This project utilizes the robust AI detection engine built by E. Schouten to run our custom-trained CowCatcher models.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system acts as a tireless digital herdsman. It processes video streams locally on your farm and only notifies you when action is required.

📷 barn camera footage ──→ 🤖 AI Computer Vision ──→ ⚡ mounting detection ──→ 💽 save image ──→ 📲 Telegram notification with image

## ✨ Key Features

* **Easy Deployment:** No Python, Anaconda, or complex environments to install. Just download and run.
* **24/7 Monitoring:** Never miss a heat, even during the night.
* **Instant Alerts:** Get direct notifications with image proof sent to your phone.
* **Data Privacy:** All video processing happens **locally** on your machine. No video is sent to the cloud.
* **Cost Effective:** Free, open-source software. You only pay for your hardware.

## 📹 Camera Setup & Best Practices
**Crucial:** The AI is only as good as the video feed. For the best results:

* **Height:** Mount cameras **3-4 meters high** to get a clear view over the cows.
* **Angle:** A downward angle (approx 45°) works best. Avoid flat, horizontal views where cows hide behind one another.
* **Lighting:** Ensure the area is lit at night, or use a camera with strong IR (Night Vision).
* **Coverage:** 1080p resolution is recommended. Avoid placing cameras facing directly into bright windows/sunlight.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To run the AI models in real-time, specific hardware is required.

### Hardware
| Component | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Graphics Card (GPU)** | **NVIDIA GTX 16-series or newer** (e.g., GTX 1660, RTX 2060, RTX 3060). <br> *Note: Older cards (e.g., GTX 10-series) must use the Docker version.* |
| **Camera** | Any IP Camera with **RTSP support**. |Optimal is connect with Lan-cables, wifi cams do work but are noticable slower and do miss frames.
| **Internet** | Required only for sending Telegram notifications. |

### Software
* **Telegram App:** Installed on your phone.
* **AI Detector:** The executable engine (instructions below).

## 🚀 Installation Guide (Windows)

Follow these four steps to get up and running in minutes.

### Step 1: Setup Telegram Notifications
You need a "Bot" to send you messages.
1.  Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**.
2.  Send the message `/newbot`.
3.  Follow the prompts to name it (e.g., `MyFarmAlertBot`).
4.  **Copy the API Token** provided (It looks like `123456:ABC-DEF1234...`).
5.  Search for **@userinfobot** in Telegram and send `/start`.
6.  **Copy your ID** (It is a number like `123456789`).

### Step 2: Download the Engine
Download the latest `aidetector.exe` from the repository that powers this tool:
👉 **[Download from AI Detector Releases](https://github.com/ESchouten/ai-detector/releases)**

### Step 3: Configure the System
1.  Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., `C:\CowCatcher`).
2.  Move `aidetector.exe` into this folder.
3.  Create a new text file in that folder named `config.json`.
4.  Paste the following code into that file:

```json
{
    "detectors": [
        {
            "model": "https://github.com/CowCatcherAI/CowCatcherAI/releases/download/modelv-14/cowcatcherV15.pt",
            "sources": [
                "rtsp://admin:YourPassword123@192.168.100.22:554/h264Preview_01_sub"
            ],
            "detection": {
                "confidence": 0.7,
                "time_max": 50,
                "timeout": 6,
                "frames_min": 3
            },
            "exporters": {
                "telegram": {
                    "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
                    "chat": "YOUR_USER_ID_HERE",
                    "confidence": 0.87
                },
                "disk": {
                    "directory": "mounts"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Important Edits:**
* **Token & Chat:** Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` and `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE` with your values from Step 1.
* **Camera Source:** Replace the `rtsp://...` URL with your camera's specific address.
    * *Tip: If you don't know your RTSP URL, check your camera manual or use a tool like "iSpy Connect Database" to find the format for your camera brand.*

### Step 4: Run
Double-click `aidetector.exe`. A black terminal window will open showing the detection logs. If you see text scrolling and no errors, the system is live!

## 📋 Configuration Reference

The `config.json` file controls the behavior of the AI detector. Here is a breakdown of the available fields:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`detectors`** | A list of detector configurations. You can define multiple detectors for different cameras. |
| **`model`** | The URL or local path to the YOLO model weights (`.pt` file). |
| **`sources`** | A list of input sources. Typically a single RTSP URL (e.g., `rtsp://...`) or a local video file path. |

### Detection Settings (`detection`)
| Field | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`confidence`** | `0.7` | Minimum certainty (0.0 - 1.0) for a frame to count as a detection. |
| **`frames_min`** | `1` | Minimum number of positive frames required to trigger an event. |
| **`timeout`** | `None` | Seconds of "silence" (no detection) before an event is considered finished. |
| **`time_max`** | `60` | Maximum duration (in seconds) for a single event window. |

### Exporters (`exporters`)
Defines where the results are sent. All exporters can be a single object or an array of objects.
*   **`telegram`**: Sends notifications to your phone.
    *   `token`: Telegram Bot token.
    *   `chat`: Telegram Chat ID.
    *   `confidence`: (Optional) Specific confidence threshold for Telegram alerts.
*   **`disk`**: Saves images locally.
    *   `directory`: Folder name for saving images.
    *   `confidence`: (Optional) Specific confidence threshold for saving images.

## ⚙️ Fine-Tuning & Advanced Setup

### Adjusting Sensitivity
If the AI is missing heats or sending false alarms, adjust the `"confidence"` value in your `config.json`:
* **0.87 (Default):** Balanced.
* **0.86 or lower:** More sensitive (Detects more, but potential false alarms).
* **0.88 or higher:** Stricter (Fewer false alarms, but might miss quick mounts).
* *Note: You must restart the application after saving changes.*

### Using Multiple Cameras
To monitor multiple areas, you can add more detector blocks to your config.

        {
            "model": "...",
            "sources": ["rtsp://192.168.1.50/stream1", "rtsp://192.168.1.52/stream1"],
            "detection": { ... },
            "exporters": { ... }
        }
    ]
}
```
</details>

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**The black window opens and closes immediately:**
This usually means there is a syntax error in your `config.json`.
* Ensure you didn't accidentally remove a quote `"` or a comma `,`.
* Ensure you pasted the **raw link** for the model, not a formatted link.

**I am getting "Connection Failed" errors:**
* Check that your computer is on the same network as the camera.
* Verify your RTSP stream URL in a media player like VLC to ensure it works.

**Frame detections are slow (200ms+):**
* Verify that NVIDIA drivers are installed and up to date.

## 🐳 Docker Usage (Advanced)

For users with older GPUs or those running home servers, we provide a Docker image.

**Prerequisites:** Docker Compose and the **NVIDIA Container Toolkit**.

1.  Create a `compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  aidetector:
    image: "ghcr.io/eschouten/ai-detector:latest"
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
      - ./detections:/app/detections
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

2.  Place your `config.json` (from Step 3 above) in the same directory.
3.  Run the container:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

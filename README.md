# 🐄 CowCatcher AI

### This is a fork of the official CowcatcherAI repository

This fork is based on the very first version of the CowcatcherAI code, originally developed by Jacob's Farm. The code is written entirely in Python and serves as a solid foundation for a variety of AI projects.
This project is easier to modify due to its Python-based structure and its standalone interface. It is ideal for developers who prefer a flexible and easily editable version — or for pioneers who appreciate the original CowcatcherAI code over the modern implementations.

**CowCatcher AI** is an open-source computer vision system designed to monitor your herd 24/7. By analyzing live footage from your barn cameras, it automatically detects "mounting" behavior—the primary sign of estrus (heat)—and instantly sends a photo notification to your smartphone via Telegram or combine it with your Home assistant setup.

## 📥 Installation

### First of All

You can install this yourself by following the guide below, or contact me for assistance, i can also do the installation for free
- **Email:** jacobsfarmsocial@gmail.com
- **Telegram:** @Jacob5456

For additional guidance, I've created video tutorials for the installation process. While they aren't completely up-to-date, they're quite helpful as the process is largely the same.

### Step 1: Download Software
1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2. Download and install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (optional)
3. Download and install [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or 7-Zip
4. Download the latest release of [CowCatcherAI](https://github.com/CowCatcherAI/CowCatcherAI/releases)  
   or with command: `git clone -b Dev https://github.com/CowCatcherAI/CowCatcherAI.git`

### Step 2: Prepare Project
1. Extract the zip file to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\Users\username\Documents\Cowcatcher`)
2. Remember the path to this folder, you'll need to reference it constantly

### Step 3: Set Up Python Environment

Open **Anaconda Prompt** and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project drive (replace C: with your drive)
C:

# Go to your project folder
cd \Users\username\Documents\Cowcatcher

# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n cowcatcher python=3.11

# Confirm with 'y' when prompted
y

# Activate the environment
conda activate cowcatcher
```

### Step 4: Install Required Packages

```bash
# Install Ultralytics YOLO
pip install ultralytics
```

### Step 5: (Only for Nvidia graphic Cards) Check GPU Support

```bash
# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

# Start Python
python

# Test CUDA availability
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available()

# Should return 'True' for GPU support
# Exit Python
exit()
```

### Step 6: Configure Batch File (Optional)
Create or modify the provided batch file for easy startup. Update the variables according to your setup:

```batch
@echo off
REM Configuration - modify these variables as needed
REM To see version conda in anaconda prompt = echo %CONDA_PREFIX%
set CONDA_PATH="C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat"
set PROJECT_DRIVE=C:
set PROJECT_FOLDER=CowCatcherAI
set SCRIPT_NAME=cowcatcher.py

REM Execute the script
call %CONDA_PATH%
%PROJECT_DRIVE%
cd %PROJECT_FOLDER%
python %SCRIPT_NAME%
pause
```

**Customizable Variables:**
- `CONDA_PATH`: Path to your Anaconda installation
- `PROJECT_DRIVE`: Drive letter where your project is located
- `PROJECT_FOLDER`: Name of your project folder
- `SCRIPT_NAME`: Name of the main Python script

## 🤖 Setting Up Telegram Bot

### Step 1: Create Bot
1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Start a chat and send `/newbot`
3. Give your bot a name: "e.g.:" `Estrus Detection`
4. Give your bot a username: `EstrusDetectionBot`
5. **Save the API token** you receive, NEVER share this token

### Step 2: Get Your User ID
1. Search for `@userinfobot` in Telegram
2. Start a chat and send `/start`
3. **Note your personal Telegram ID**

### Step 3: Set Up Configuration
Edit the `config.py` file in your project folder:

```python
# Telegram configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_ID_HERE"

# Camera configuration
RTSP_URL_CAMERA1 = "rtsp://username:password@IP_ADDRESS:554/stream"
```

## 🚀 Starting the System
Use the configured .bat file, or follow these steps:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
C:
cd CowCatcherAI

# Start the detection program
python cowcatcher.py
```

Upon successful startup, you'll receive a confirmation message in Telegram.

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

The system has various adjustable threshold values:

- **SAVE_THRESHOLD** (0.7): Threshold for saving images
- **NOTIFY_THRESHOLD** (0.85): Threshold for sending notifications
- **PEAK_DETECTION_THRESHOLD** (0.90): Threshold for peak detection
- **COOLDOWN_PERIOD** (40 seconds): Time between notifications
- **MAX_SCREENSHOTS** (2): Number of photos per notification
- **SOUND_EVERY_N_NOTIFICATIONS** Notification WITH sound every 5 messages

This software is intended as a tool and does not replace professional knowledge and experience. The AI may give false notifications; the user remains responsible for the final assessment and decision. Physical inspection and identification of the animal remain essential.

Although this solution is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, the underlying technology is not new. The computer vision used is based on YOLO, a proven technique that has been applied for years for object and motion detection. The Telegram notifications also use an existing API. Despite appearing innovative, it involves a smart combination of existing technologies.se positives or negatives; the user remains responsible for all final breeding decisions.
